# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of customer data and their churn status. The objective is to analyze key features influencing churn and build predictive models to identify customers likely to churn.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and feature distributions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and transforming existing ones.
- **Model Building:** Applying classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Insights:** Actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
